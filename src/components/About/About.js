      <h4> Based on Almaty, Kazakhstan üìç</h4>
      <p>
        Hey there! I'm Zhandos, a beginner web developer and QA engineer. I am passionate about what I do and love diving into the world of web development and quality assurance. 
        My journey in IT world started from <a href="Verigram.ai">Verigram</a> in 2021 January. I started working as Data Annotator and grew up to Team Lead of Data Annotation, and we also, as a team,
        manually tested face recognition and document recognition services. Most of time I worked with large data sets, parsing and labeling them. In 2023 April I enrolled to internship in <a href="a1qa.com">A1qa</a>. 
        And now i'm doing Quality Assurance automation course and i continue to do this.
